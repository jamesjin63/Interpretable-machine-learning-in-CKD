# Interpretable-machine-learning-in-CKD
 This paper presents a machine learning study for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression risk using clinical data

 ## statement
 This is the source R code for <Interpretable Machine learning for Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease Progression Risk>, and all the data were available in [Here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Chronic_ kidney_disease_in_patients_at_high_risk_of_cardiovascular _disease_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates_A_population-bas ed_study/6711155?file=12242270)

 You could find the figures and tables done in the main manuscript with relate code, and 
 all the parameters setting for ML in predictions.
